# Programming C Summative Project

## Overview

This project involves a series of tasks to assess your skills in various aspects of programming in C and related technologies. The assessment is designed to evaluate your ability to manipulate strings, use function pointers, handle multithreading, work with file systems, and write bash scripts.

### Assessment Outcomes

By completing this assessment, you will be able to:
- Manipulate strings using C language
- Use function pointers properly in C language
- Design circuits and deploy the appropriate program
- Implement multiple threads
- Manipulate the file system using structures
- Write effective bash scripts

### Instructions

- This assessment must be completed individually.
- The project will be graded out of 20 points.
- Each student will be required to present their work, which will be graded out of 5 points.
- No extensions will be granted past the due date.
- The presentation panel may include additional facilitators beyond the course lead.

## Tasks

### Q1. Sorting Names [4pts]

You are required to sort 100 names in an array either in ascending or descending order. The user will input "asc" for ascending order or "desc" for descending order.

**Tasks:**
1. Use a function pointer to pass an array of names and a callback function for sorting.
2. Implement a function to count the number of names in the array.
3. Create an array of functions to allow the user to choose between the sorting function and the counting function.

### Q2. Remote for Light [5pts]

Design a circuit to control a light bulb using a remote control. Components include a power source, relay, bulb, resistors, Arduino board, sensors, and remote control. Write a program to achieve the desired functionality.

### Q3. Multithreads [4pts]

Compute the sum of `n` numbers using 10 threads. The number `n`, greater than 1000, will be entered from the keyboard. Each thread will handle `n/10` elements. The program should aggregate all thread results to get the total sum.

### Q4. Data Storage and Computation [4pts]

Record grades for `n` students (5 < n < 100) for three courses using structures. Each student's data (full name and grades for Programming in C, Mobile Application Development, and Communications) should be stored in a file. Each student's details should be recorded on a separate line.

### Q5. System Performance [3pts]

Write a bash script to monitor system performance, logging CPU usage percentage and memory usage percentage every 2 seconds. The script should append this data to a log file.
